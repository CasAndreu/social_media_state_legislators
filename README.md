# Using Social Media Data to Reveal Patterns of Policy Engagement in State Legislatures

This repository contains the replication code for the paper _"Using Social Media Data to Reveal Patterns of Policy Engagement in State Legislatures"_, authored by Julia Payson, Andreu Casas, Jonathan Nagler, Richard Bonneau, and Joshua A. Tucker. Accepted for publication at _State Politics and Policy Quarterly_.

> __Abstract__:
> State governments are tasked with making important policy decisions in the United States. How do state legislators use their public communications -particularly social media- to engage with policy debates? Due to previous data limitations, we lack systematic information about whether and how state legislators publicly discuss policy and how this behavior varies across contexts. Using Twitter data and state of the art topic modeling techniques, we introduce a method to study state legislator policy priorities and apply the method to fifteen U.S. states in 2018. We show that we are able to accurately capture the policy issues discussed by state legislators with substantially more accuracy than existing methods. We then present initial findings that validate the method and speak to debates in the literature. For example, state legislators in competitive districts are more likely to discuss policy than those in less competitive districts, and legislators from more professional legislatures discuss policy at similar rates to those in less professional legislatures. We conclude by discussing promising avenues for future state politics research using this new approach.

## Data
The `./data/` directory contains the necessary data to replicate the analytical figures and tables of the paper. Below, we describe each of the datasets in this directory:

- `tweets-only-id-variables.csv`: a dataset with the `user_name`, `user_id`, `tweet_id` and `date` of the 2018 collected for the state legislators under analysis.

- `sample-10000-legtweets.csv`: a dataset with about 10,000 tweets sent in 2018 by state legislators under analysis, and the topic we predicted the tweets to be about. We use this dataset to explore what are the most distinctive text features for each topic. The variable `tweet_id` contains the ID for each tweet, `top_topic` contains the predited topic, `clean_text_cnn` contains processed text used to generate topic predictions with the CNN model, `user_id` provides information about the Twitter ID of the user, and `user_name` provides the user handle.

- `model_data_basic.csv`: a dataset with the basic legislator-level covariates included in the regressions reported in the paper.

## Code
The `./code/` directory contains separate scripts to replicate each analytical figure in the article. The `./figures/` directory contains a copy of each of the figures generated by these scripts. 

- [`01-table02.R`](https://github.com/CasAndreu/extreme_sites_scarce_boomerang/blob/main/code/01-fig1b-browsing-data.R): replicates Figure 1b of the paper, in which we use the browsing  data we collected for some of the participants assigned to treatment to check whether on average they actually complied with the treatment.
